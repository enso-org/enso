/** This component renders its children outside the current DOM hierarchy.
 *
 * React [doesn't support](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/13097) portal API in SSR, so, if you want to
 * render a Portal in SSR, use prop `disabled`.
 *
 * By default, Portal's children render under the `<Root />` component.
 *
 * ***Important***: Since React doesn't support portals on SSR, `<Portal />` children render in the next tick.
 * If you need to make some computations, use the `onMount` callback
 * @see https://reactjs.org/docs/portals.html
 * @example ```jsx
 *  <div>
 *    Portal will be rendered outside me!
 *
 *    <Portal>
 *      <div>some content will be showed outside of parent container</div>
 *    </Portal>
 *  </div>
 * ```
