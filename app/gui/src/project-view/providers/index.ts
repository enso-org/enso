/**
 * Create a pair of functions that allow to provide and inject a store in the current component's
 * context. The store is created on demand using the provided factory function. Once a store is
 * provided by a component, all its descendants will be able to access it using the corresponding
 * inject function.The store instance is **NOT a singleton**. Each component that provides
 * the store will create its own instance, and each component that injects the store will receive
 * the instance from the closest ancestor component that provided it.
 *
 * When creating a store, you usually want to reexport the `provideFn` and `injectFn` as renamed
 * functions to make it easier to use the store in components without any name collisions.
 * ```ts
 * export { injectFn as injectSpecificThing, provideFn as provideSpecificThing }
 * const { provideFn, injectFn } = createContextStore('specific thing', thatThingFactory)
 * ```
 *
 * Under the hood, this uses Vue's [Context API], therefore it can only be used within a component's
 * setup function.
 * @param name A user-friendly name for the store, used for error messages and debugging. The name
 * has no influence on the standard runtime behavior of the store, and doesn't have to be unique.
 * @param factory A factory function that creates the store. The parameters expected by the factory
 * will match the parameters of the generated `provideFn` function.
 * @returns A pair of functions, `provideFn` and `injectFn`. The `provideFn` function creates the
 * store instance and provides it to the context, allowing child components to access it. The
 * `injectFn` function retrieves the store instance provided by any of the an ancestor components.
 *
 * [Context API]: https://vuejs.org/guide/components/provide-inject.html#provide-inject
