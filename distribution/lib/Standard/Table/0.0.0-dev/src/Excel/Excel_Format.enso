## Read the file to a `Table` from an Excel file
type Excel_Format
    ## Read Excels files into a Table or Vector.

       Arguments:
       - section: The `Excel_Section` to read from the workbook.
         This can be one of:
         - `Workbook` - open the workbook as a connection.
         - `Sheet_Names` - outputs a `Vector` of sheet names.
         - `Range_Names` - outputs a `Vector` of range names.
         - `Worksheet` - outputs a `Table` containing the specified sheet.
         - `Cell_Range` - outputs a `Table` containing the specified range.
       - headers: If set to `True`, the first row is used as column names. If
         set to `False`, the column names are Excel column names. If set to
         `Infer`, the process tries to infer if headers are present on the first
          row. If the column names are not unique, numeric suffixes will be
          appended to disambiguate them.
       - xls_format:
         If set to `True`, the file is read as an Excel 95-2003 format.
         If set to `False`, the file is read as an Excel 2007+ format.
         `Infer` will attempt to deduce this from the extension of the filename.
       - default_sheet: The default sheet to use if `section` is set to
         `Excel_Section.Workbook`.
    Excel (section:Excel_Section=Excel_Section.Workbook) (headers:(Boolean|Infer)=Infer) (xls_format:(Boolean|Infer)=Infer) (default_sheet:Text="EnsoSheet")

       Implements the `Table.write` for this `File_Format`.

       Depending on the `section` will control where to write.
       - If `Excel_Section.Workbook` (the default), the `table` will be written
         to a new sheet in the workbook named `Sheet<n>` where n is the first
         integer >1 that is not already used as a sheet name. If too many sheets
         are present an `Illegal_Argument` error will be thrown.
       - If `Excel_Section.Worksheet`, the `table` will be written to the
         specified sheet (either adding or replacing).
       - If `Excel_Section.Cell_Range`, the `table` will be written to the
         specified range.

        Arguments:
        - file: The file to write to.
        - table: The table to write.
        - on_existing_file: What to do if the file already exists.
        - match_columns: How to match columns between the table and the file.
        - on_problems: What to do if there are problems reading the file.
