## Indicates that the provided indices matched columns already matched by
   others, so they do not introduce any new columns to the input.

  For example, if the table has only one column, then selecting

## Indicates that multiple `Column_Type_Selector` match the same column.

   If all matching selectors indicate the same type, the warning is reported but
   a parse is attempted anyway. If mixed types are requested, the column is not
   parsed due to ambiguity.
