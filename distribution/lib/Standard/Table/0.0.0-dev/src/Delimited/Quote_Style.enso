type Quote_Style
    ## Does not handle quotes at all.

       No quote parsing is done when reading the file.
       In write mode, values are not quoted even if this would result in an
       invalid file.
    No_Quotes

    ## Specifies the style of quotes when reading or writing a `Delimited` file.

       Arguments:
       - always_quote: Applies only to write mode. Specifies if all values
         should be quoted even if the quotes are not necessary. If set to
         `False`, only empty values and values containing the delimiter or the
         quote character are quoted.
       - quote: The quote character denotes the start and end of a quoted value.
         Quoted items are not split on the delimiter and can also contain
         newlines. Empty input strings must be quoted (e.g. "") as otherwise an
         empty value is treated as `Nothing`.
       - quote_escape: The character to escape the quote character in a quoted
         value. For example, if both `quote` and `quote_escape` are set to `"`,
         then escaping quotes is done by double quotes: `"ab""cd"` will yield
         the text `ab"cd`. Another popular choice for `quote_escape` is the `\`
         character. Then `"ab\"cd"` will yield the same text.

       ! Quote Character

         The quote and escape characters must consist of exactly one code-point
         (i.e. it can be only one character and complex characters like emojis
         may not be used).
