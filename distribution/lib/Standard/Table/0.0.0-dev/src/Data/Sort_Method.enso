from Standard.Base import all
import Standard.Base.Data.Ordering.Sort_Order

## Specifies the sort methodology.

   Arguments:
   - order: Sort ordering - ascending by default.
   - case_sensitive: Case sensitivity - case sensitive by default.
   - natural_order: Whether to use natural ordering. Standard ordering as
     defined by `Text.compare_to` is used by default.
type Sort_Method (order : Sort_Order = Sort_Order.Ascending) (case_sensitive : (True | Case_Insensitive) = True) (natural_order : Boolean = False)

## UNSTABLE
   A temporary workaround to allow the `Sort_Method` constructor to work with
   default arguments.

   It is needed, because there are issues with relying on default arguments of
   Atom constructors, as described in the following issue:
   https://github.com/enso-org/enso/issues/1600
   Once that issue is fixed, it can be removed.

Sort_Method.new : Sort_Order -> (True | Case_Insensitive) -> Boolean -> Sort_Method
Sort_Method.new order=Sort_Order.Ascending case_sensitive=True natural_order=False =
    Sort_Method order case_sensitive natural_order
