## PRIVATE
   Creates a new database table with the provided structure and returns the name
   of the created table.

   The user-facing function that handles the dry-run logic.

   ? Transactionality

     The create operation itself is just one CREATE statement, so it does not
     need to be done inside of a transaction.
     The only edge case to handle is - if the table already exists, we want to
     customize the behaviour based on `allow_existing`. This is achieved by
     intercepting the 'already exists' error.
