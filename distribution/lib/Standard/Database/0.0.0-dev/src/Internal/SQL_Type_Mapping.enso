type SQL_Type_Mapping
    ## PRIVATE
       ADVANCED
       Converts the given Value_Type to its corresponding SQL_Type.

       Some SQL dialects may not support all Value_Types (in fact most will
       have at least a few exceptions, and some like SQLite may have very
       limited support). If an SQL_Type that matches the Value_Type cannot be
       found, a closest approximate match is returned instead. If an exact match
       cannot be found, an `Inexact_Type_Coercion` warning is reported according
       to the `on_problems` setting.

       If the conversion is exact, it should be reversible, i.e.
       `sql_type_to_value_type (value_type_to_sql x Problem_Behavior.Report_Error) = x`.

    ## PRIVATE
       ADVANCED
       Returns a `SQL_Type_Reference` that will resolve to the resulting type of
       the given operation.

       In most cases this will just delegate to `infer_from_database_callback`
       which should ask the particular database backend to infer the type, but
       some specific cases may override the default behavior. The notable
       example is the ability to support Boolean types in SQLite.

       The particular operation is identified by its name. It also gets a vector
       of supplied arguments in case the result type may depend on them. The
       arguments are passed as-is, i.e. they may be Database columns or raw Enso
       values. The generated IR expression is also provided as
       depending on the backend the raw arguments or the target expression may
       be more useful to create the return type. In particular, the expression
       may be used as an argument for the `infer_from_database_callback`.
    infer_return_type : (SQL_Expression -> SQL_Type_Reference) -> Text -> Vector -> SQL_Expression -> SQL_Type_Reference
    infer_return_type infer_from_database_callback op_name arguments expression =

        Unimplemented.throw "This is an interface only."

    ## PRIVATE
       Gets a list of type suggestions and returns a list of type overrides for
       a query.

       This is used to customize type override behavior - most backends will
       correctly infer types from metadata, so unless specifically overridden,
       we can rely on the `ResultSet` metadata and reduce any overhead. However,
       in some backends (SQLite) the metadata may not be as useful (in SQLite,
       the metadata is changing depending on the result row, so the first row
       that is usually used may not reflect the needs of the whole column) -
       this method allows to provide custom overrides in such case.

       If the vector contains a `Nothing` at a given position, that column type
       will be inferred from the `ResultSet` metadata. If it contains a concrete
       type, that type will be used instead, regardless of what is coming from
       the metadata.
