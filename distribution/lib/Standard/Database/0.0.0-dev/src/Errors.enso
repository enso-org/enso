type Null_Values_In_Key_Columns
    ## PRIVATE
       Indicates that the source table contained NULL values in key columns.
       Rows containing NULL values as part of their key will not be correctly

type Unsupported_Database_Encoding
    ## PRIVATE
       A warning indicating that the encoding inferred to be used by the
       database is not supported by Enso.

       This should not affect data passed to/from the database, as the
       connection driver should handle the translation. However, it affects how
       identifier names are being handled, and it may cause trouble when the
       length of identifier names is wrongly inferred, causing aliasing of names
       and generating invalid queries.
    Warning message

    ## PRIVATE
       Pretty print the unsupported database encoding warning.

    to_display_text self = self.message
