 * Original adaption from Apache Hive. That adaption contains a {@code hash64} method that is not part of the original
 * MurmurHash3 code. It is not recommended to use these methods. They will be removed in a future release. To obtain a
 * 64-bit hash use half of the bits from the {@code hash128x64} methods using the input data converted to bytes.
