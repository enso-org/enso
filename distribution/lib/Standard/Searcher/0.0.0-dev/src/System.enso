## Sometimes Enso alone isn't enough for your work. That is why you're provided
   with a robust suite of tools to use to interact with the system on which it
   is running.

   From involving external processes in your workflow, to working with the file
   system directly, to reading information from your computer's environment,
   Enso's System library has you covered.

   > Example
     Create a new file pointing to the `data.csv` file in the project directory.

         import Standard.Base.System.File.File
         import Standard.Examples

         example_new = File.new Examples.csv_path

   > Example
     Get the program's current working directory.

         import Standard.Base.System.File.File

         example_cwd = File.current_directory

   > Example
     Get the current user's home directory.

         import Standard.Base.System.File.File

         example_home = File.home

   > Example
     Call the "echo" command.

         import Standard.Base.System.Platform
         import Standard.Base.System.Process

         example_run = case Platform.os of
             Platform.OS.Windows -> Process.run "PowerShell" ["-Command", "exit 42"]
             _ -> Process.run "bash" ["-c", "exit 42"]
