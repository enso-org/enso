## With all your data combined, the next step is to get insight from your data.
   This is the process of transformation, shaping it into a form that tells you
   what you want to know.

   Enso provides a whole host of utilities for data transformation. These
   include being able to to perform arithmetic and text operations on columns,
   as well as the ability to mask columns based on criteria you specify.

   > Example
     Select only the items where more than half the stock has been sold.

         import Standard.Examples

         example_where =
             table = Examples.inventory_table
             mask = (table.at "sold_stock" > (table.at "total_stock" / 2))
             table.filter mask

   > Example
     Multiply each element of the column by itself.

         import Standard.Examples

         example_map = Examples.integer_column.map (x -> x * x)

   > Example
     Sort the shop inventory based on the per-item price in descending order.

         import Standard.Examples
         from Standard.Table import Sort_Column_Selector, Sort_Column

         example_sort =
            table = Examples.inventory_table
            table.order_by (Sort_Column_Selector.By_Name [Sort_Column.Name "price" Sort_Direction.Descending])

   > Example
     Add two columns to each other.

         import Standard.Examples

         example_plus = Examples.decimal_column + Examples.integer_column
