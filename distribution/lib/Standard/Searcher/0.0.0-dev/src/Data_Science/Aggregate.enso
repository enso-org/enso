## With your data in the state that you want, the next step is to pull useful
   summaries from it to give you insight. This is the process of _aggregation_
   or _summarisation_.

   Enso provides robust facilities for getting aggregate results from your data,
   all built on a flexible foundation of grouping.

   > Example
     Compute the number of transactions that each item has participated in, as
     well as the number of each item sold across those transactions.

         import Standard.Examples

         example_group =
             transactions = Examples.transactions_table
             item_names = Examples.inventory_table.at "item_name"
             aggregated = transactions.group by="item_id"
             num_transactions = aggregated.at "transaction_id" . reduce .length . rename "transaction_count"
             num_sold = aggregated.at "quantity" . reduce .sum . rename "num_sold"
             item_names.join [num_transactions, num_sold]

   > Example
     Compute the maximum value of a column, the minimum value, the sum of its
     values, and its mean, and return these in a vector.

         import Standard.Examples

         example_aggregate =
             column = Examples.integer_column
             max = column.max
             min = column.min
             sum = column.sum
             mean = column.mean
             [max, min, sum, mean]
