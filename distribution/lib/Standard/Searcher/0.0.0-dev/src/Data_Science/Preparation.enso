## As nice as it would be to have your data all ready for analysis, this is
   rarely the case. The process of getting it ready to provide insights is known
   as data preparation.

   This section of the library contains a curated selection of tools that help
   you to get the best out of your data. From dealing with missing values to
   getting rid of erroneous rows and columns, the tools here are specialised for
   getting the most out of your data.

   > Example
     Get the item name and price columns from the shop inventory.

         import Standard.Examples
         from Standard.Table.Data.Column_Selector as Column_Selector_Module import By_Name

         example_select =
             Examples.inventory_table.select_columns (By_Name ["item_name", "price"])

   > Example
     Remove any rows that contain missing values from the table.

         import Standard.Examples

         example_drop_missing_rows =

   > Example
     Remove any columns that contain missing values from the table.
