## A type representing interactions with polyglot languages.
    Polyglot is a term that refers to other languages (such as Java) that are
    running on the same JVM.

@Builtin_Type
type Polyglot

## Reads the number of elements in a given polyglot array object.

   Arguments:
   - array: a polyglot array object, originating in any supported language.
get_array_size : Any -> Integer
get_array_size array = @Builtin_Method "Polyglot.get_array_size"

## Reads the element in a given polyglot array object.

   Arguments:
   - index: The index to get the element from.
read_array_element : Any -> Integer -> Any
read_array_element array index = @Builtin_Method "Polyglot.read_array_element"

## Executes a polyglot function object (e.g. a lambda).

   Arguments:
   - callable: The polyglot function object to execute.
   - arguments: A vector of arguments to callable.
execute : Any -> Vector -> Any
execute callable arguments = @Builtin_Method "Polyglot.execute"

## Performs a by-name lookup for a member in a polyglot object.

    Arguments:
    - object: The polyglot object on which to perform the member lookup.
    - member_name: The textual name of the member to lookup.

    > Example
      Look up the field a on an object o.
          Polyglot.get_member o "a"
get_member : Any -> Text
get_member object member_name = @Builtin_Method "Polyglot.get_member"

## Returns a polyglot array of all of the members of the provided object.

    Arguments:
    - object: The object from which to get a list of member names.

    > Example
      Get a list of the fields for an object o.
          Polyglot.get_members o
get_members : Any -> Array
get_members object = @Builtin_Method "Polyglot.get_members"

## Instantiates a polyglot object using the provided constructor.

    Arguments:
    - constructor: The constructor with which to instantiate the object.
    - arguments: A vector of the arguments to pass to the polyglot
     constructor.

    > Example
     Instantiate a new Java Integer with the value 1.
         Polyglot.new Integer [1]
new : Any -> Vector -> Any
new constructor arguments = @Builtin_Method "Polyglot.new"

## Invokes a method on a polyglot object by name.

    Arguments:
    - target: The polyglot object on which to call the method.
    - name: The name of the method.
    - arguments: The arguments to pass to the method given by name.
invoke : Any -> Text -> Vector -> Any
invoke target name arguments = @Builtin_Method "Polyglot.invoke"

## ADVANCED
   UNSTABLE

    Checks if `value` defines a source location.

    Source locations are typically exposed by functions, classes, sometimes
    also other objects to specify their allocation sites.
has_source_location : Any -> Boolean
has_source_location value = @Builtin_Method "Polyglot.has_source_location"

## ADVANCED
   UNSTABLE

    Gets the source location of `value`.

    Source locations are typically exposed by functions, classes, sometimes
    also other objects to specify their allocation sites.
    This method will throw a polyglot exception if
    `Polyglot.has_source_location value` returns `False`.
get_source_location : Any -> Source_Location
get_source_location value = @Builtin_Method "Polyglot.get_source_location"

## Checks if a polyglot language is installed in the runtime environment.

    Arguments:
    - langauge_name: The name of the language to test
is_language_installed : Text -> Boolean
is_language_installed language_name = @Builtin_Method "Polyglot.is_language_installed"

## ADVANCED
   UNSTABLE

   Returns the executable name of a polyglot object.
get_executable_name : Any -> Text
get_executable_name = @Builtin_Method "Polyglot.get_executable_name"
