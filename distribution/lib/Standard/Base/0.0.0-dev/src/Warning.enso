## A representation of a dataflow warning attached to a value.
@Builtin_Type
type Warning
    ## UNSTABLE

       Attaches a new warning to the value.
    attach : Any -> Any -> Any
    attach warning value =
        origin = Runtime.get_stack_trace
        attach_with_stacktrace value warning (origin.drop (Index_Sub_Range.First 1))

    ## UNSTABLE

       Gets all the warnings attached to the given value. Warnings are returned in the
       reverse-chronological order with respect to their attachment time.
    get_all : Any -> Vector Warning
    get_all value = Vector.from_polyglot_array (get_all_array value)

    ## UNSTABLE
       ADVANCED

       Sets a new list of warnings for the given value. Any warnings already present
       in `value` will be lost.

       Arguments:
       - value: the value to which warnings should be set to.
       - warnings: vector of warnings to set to the value.
    set : Any -> Vector Warning -> Any
    set value warnings = set_array value warnings.to_array

    ## UNSTABLE
       Maps warnings attached to a value.

       Arguments:
       - mapper: the function to apply to all warnings. If it returns `Some` value,
         the given warning is replaced with the new value. If it returns `Nothing`
         the original warning remains unaffected.
       - value: the value whose warnings should be modified.

       > Example
         Map all `No_Match_Found` warnings to more specific messages. Any other
         attached warnings are unaffected.

             mapper warning = case warning of
                 Matching.No_Matches_Found criteria -> Maybe.Some (Missing_Input_Columns criteria)
                 _ -> Nothing
             Warning.map_attached_warnings mapper value
    map_attached_warnings : (Any -> Maybe Any) -> Any -> Any
    map_attached_warnings mapper value =
        map_attached_warnings_helper mapper value 1

    ## UNSTABLE
       An utility function which applies the mapping function both to any attached
       warnings and dataflow errors.

       Arguments:
       - mapper: the function to apply to all warnings or errors. If it returns
         `Some` value, the given warning or error is replaced with the new value. If
         it returns `Nothing` the original warning or error remains unaffected.
       - value: the value whose errors or warnings should be modified.

       > Example
         Map all `No_Match_Found` warnings or errors to more specific messages. Any
         other attached warnings or errors are unaffected.

             mapper error = case error of
                 Matching.No_Matches_Found criteria -> Maybe.Some (Missing_Input_Columns criteria)
                 _ -> Nothing
             Warning.map_warnings_and_errors mapper value
    map_warnings_and_errors : (Any -> Maybe Any) -> Any -> Any
    map_warnings_and_errors mapper value =
        mapped_warnings_or_error = map_attached_warnings_helper mapper value 1
        mapped_warnings_or_error.catch Any error->
            case mapper error of
                Maybe.Some new_error -> Error.throw new_error
                ## If the mapper did not want to affect the error, we return the
                   original dataflow error as-is, to preserve its stacktrace.
                Nothing -> mapped_warnings_or_error

    ## UNSTABLE
       A helper function which selects warnings matching a predicate and returns a
       pair whose first element is the original value with the matched warnings
       removed and the second element is the list of matched warnings.

       Arguments:
       - value: the value whose warnings are to be filtered.
       - predicate: a predicate specifying which warnings to detach. The predicate
         receives the warnings' payloads as its argument.

       > Example
         Detach warnings of a specific type.

             result = Warning.detach_selected_warnings value (_.is_a Illegal_State.Error)
             result.first # `value` with the matched warnings removed
             result.second # the list of matched warnings
    detach_selected_warnings : Any -> (Any -> Boolean) -> Pair Any Vector
    detach_selected_warnings value predicate =
        warnings = Warning.get_all value
        result = warnings.partition w-> predicate w.value
        matched = result.first
        remaining = result.second
        Pair.new (Warning.set value remaining) matched

    ## UNSTABLE
       A helper function which gathers warnings matching some predicate and passes
       them into a function which can aggregate them.

       The merger function will not be called at all if no warnings match the
       criteria.

       Arguments:
       - value: the value whose warnings will be transformed.
       - matcher: a predicate selecting warnings to merge.
       - merger: a function taking a list of found payloads which should return a
         list of new warnings that should be attached. It returns a list to not
         limit it to merging warnings into a single warning.

       > Example
         Merge `No_Matches_Found` warnings into a single such warning.

             Warning.merge_matched_warnings value (_.is_a No_Matches_Found) warnings->
                 all_criteria = warnings.flat_map .criteria
                 [No_Matches_Found all_criteria]
    merge_matched_warnings : Any -> (Any -> Boolean) -> (Vector -> Vector) -> Any
    merge_matched_warnings value matcher merger =
        result = Warning.detach_selected_warnings value matcher
        if result.second.is_empty then result.first else
            new_warnings = merger (result.second.map .value)
            new_warnings.fold result.first acc-> warning->
                Warning.attach warning acc

    ## UNSTABLE

       Returns the warning value – usually its explanation or other contents.
    value : Any
    value self = @Builtin_Method "Warning.value"

    ## UNSTABLE
       ADVANCED

       A stack trace for the original warning creation.
    origin : Vector Stack_Trace_Element
    origin self = @Builtin_Method "Warning.origin"

    ## UNSTABLE
       ADVANCED

       A list of locations where the warning was reassigned in the order of
       latest-first.

       Warnings are reassigned whenever they interact with specific language
       elements:
       - When pattern matching, the warnings of the scrutinee will be reassigned
         to the `case` expression result.
       - When calling a method, warnings assigned to `self` will be reassigned to
         the method return value.
       - When calling a polyglot function or method, warnings assigned to any
         arguments will be accumulated in the return value.
       - The standard library methods reassign warnings such that their dataflow
         nature is preserved.
    reassignments : Vector Stack_Trace_Element
    reassignments self =
        Vector.from_polyglot_array self.get_reassignments . map r->
            loc = case Polyglot.has_source_location r of
                False -> Nothing
                True -> Source_Location.Value (Polyglot.get_source_location r)
            Stack_Trace_Element.Value (Polyglot.get_executable_name r) loc

    ## PRIVATE

       Builtin method for getting the list of locations where the warnings was reassigned.
       Should use `Warning.reassignments` instead.
    get_reassignments : Array Any
    get_reassignments self = @Builtin_Method "Warning.get_reassignments"

## PRIVATE

   Creates a new instance of the primitive warning value.
   Arguments:
   - payload: value to which a Warning will be associated with.
   - origin: stacktrace representing the location where the warning is being created at.
create : Any -> Any -> Warning
create payload origin = @Builtin_Method "Warning.create"

## PRIVATE

   Builtin utility function which attaches a new warning to the value
   and, compared to `Warning.attach` requires an explicit stacktrace associated with it.
attach_with_stacktrace : Any -> Any -> Vector Stack_Trace_Element -> Any
attach_with_stacktrace value warning origin = @Builtin_Method "Warning.attach_with_stacktrace"

## PRIVATE

   Builtin function that gets all the warnings attached to the given value.
get_all_array : Any -> Array Warning
get_all_array value = @Builtin_Method "Warning.get_all_array"

## PRIVATE

   Sets a new list of warnings for the given value. Any warnings already present
   in `value` will be lost.

   Arguments:
   - value: the value to which warnings should be set to.
   - warnings: array of warnings to set to the value.
set_array : Any -> Array Warning -> Any
set_array value warnings = @Builtin_Method "Warning.set_array"

## PRIVATE
   Maps warnings attached to a value.

   An internal helper function to avoid repeating the implementation.
map_attached_warnings_helper : (Any -> Maybe Any) -> Any -> Integer -> Any
map_attached_warnings_helper mapper value frames_to_drop =
    warnings = Warning.get_all value
    mapped_warnings = warnings.map warning->
        case mapper warning.value of
            Maybe.Some new_payload ->
                self_call_name = "Warning.map_attached_warnings_helper"
                stack_trace = Runtime.get_stack_trace
                stack_trace_up_to_this_function = stack_trace.drop (Index_Sub_Range.While element-> element.name != self_call_name)
                new_origin = stack_trace_up_to_this_function.drop (Index_Sub_Range.First 1+frames_to_drop)
                create new_payload new_origin
            ## If the mapper did not want to affect this warning, we return the
               original (unwrapped) warning instance.
