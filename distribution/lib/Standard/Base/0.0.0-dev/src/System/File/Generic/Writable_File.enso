## PRIVATE
   Any type that represents a file that can be written to should be convertible
   to this common type-class.

   This allows our code to work with any kind of file backend, e.g. the local
   file system as well as remote ones like S3, using the same basic interface.

   The type-class currently provides the following capabilities:
   - write_strategy: a `File_Write_Strategy` instance denoting how to handle
     file writing depending on `Existing_File_Behavior` and dry run settings.
   - exists: the underlying `file` should have an `exists` method available,
     because it is used by some logic as an early exit condition.
type Writable_File
    ## PRIVATE
       Arguments:
       - file: the underlying file that can be written to.
       - write_strategy: the strategy defining how to write to the file.
       - file_for_return: the file instance that will be returned by write
         operations. This is usually the same as `file`, but when writing
         through a proxy (e.g. data link), the `file` will resolve to a target
         file, but we want the operations to still return the original proxy
         object, hence a distinction is needed.

          target should probably not be considered local, because that may come with too many assumptions.
        self.file.is_a File

    ## PRIVATE
       This helper method may be used if the logic for writing the file requires a local filesystem file
       (e.g. using some external libraries that prefer to work with a Java File).
       It downloads a remote file to a local temporary location, runs the action
       and then uploads the resulting file back to the remote backend.
    write_requiring_local_file self (existing_file_behavior : Existing_File_Behavior) (action : File -> Any) -> Any =
        self.write_strategy.write_with_local_file self.file existing_file_behavior action

    ## PRIVATE
       Writes a local file to this `Writable_File` destination.
       This is used by `File.copy_to` and `File.move_to` to possibly implement
       the upload more efficiently (avoiding duplicated temporary files).

## PRIVATE
   If a conversion to `File_Format_Metadata` is needed, we delegate to the underlying file.
   Every `Writable_File` should be able to provide its file format metadata.
File_Format_Metadata.from (that : Writable_File) = File_Format_Metadata.from that.file

## PRIVATE
   If a conversion to `File_Like` is needed, we delegate to the underlying file.
File_Like.from (that : Writable_File) = File_Like.from that.file
