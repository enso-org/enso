    ## Replace the existing file in-place, with the new file.

       Note: There is a risk of data loss if a failure occurs during the write
       operation.
    Overwrite

    ## Creates a backup of the existing file (by appending a `.bak` suffix to
       the name) before replacing it with the new contents.

       Note: This requires sufficient storage to have two copies of the file.
             If an existing `.bak` file exists, it will be replaced.
    Backup

    ## Appends data to the existing file.
    Append

    ## If the file already exists, a `File_Error.Already_Exists` error is
       raised.
    Error

    ## PRIVATE
       Runs the `action` which is given a file output stream and should write
       the required contents to it.

       The handle is configured depending on the specified behavior, it may
       point to a temporary file, for example. The stream may only be used while
       the action is being executed and it should not be stored anywhere for
       later.

       The `action` may not be run at all in case the `Error` behavior is
       selected.

    ## Here we manually check if the target file is writable. This is necessary,
       because the `Backup` scenario would go around the original file not being
       writable by moving it (which is permitted for read-only files too) and
       then writing a new file and removing the old one (it is often possible to
       delete a read-only file). So without this check, the `Backup` mode would
       be able to replace contents of a read-only file, which is not desired.
       Thus we add this additional check to ensure the operation will proceed
       only if it is allowed. Other scenarios do not need this check, as they
       write to the file directly and will fail if the file is not writable.
