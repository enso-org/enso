## PRIVATE

   Create a system process, returning the exit code, and the outputs to both
   standard out and standard error.

   Arguments:
   - command: The name of the system process.
   - arguments: An array of arguments to the system process.
   - input: The input to pass to the process via standard input.
   - redirect_in: Specifies if the standard input of the program should be
     redirected to the started process.
   - redirect_out: Specifies if the standard output of the started process
     should be redirected to the program's standard output.
   - redirect_err: Specifies if the standard error output of the started
     process should be redirected to the program's standard error output.
create_process : Text -> Array -> Text -> Boolean -> Boolean -> Boolean -> System_Process_Result
create_process command arguments input redirect_in redirect_out redirect_err = @Builtin_Method "System.create_process"

## Exits the Enso program, returning the provided code to the parent
   process.

   Arguments:
   - code: The numerical exit code for the Enso program.

   > Example
     Exit the Enso program with a failure.

         System.exit 42
exit : Integer -> Nothing
exit code = @Builtin_Method "System.exit"

## Gets the nanosecond resolution system time at the moment of the call.

   > Example
     Getting the current value of the nanosecond timer.

         System.nano_time
nano_time : Integer
nano_time = @Builtin_Method "System.nano_time"

## PRIVATE

   Get the name of the current platform upon which the program is running.
os : Text
os = @Builtin_Method "System.os"

## PRIVATE
   Returns the default line separator for the platform that the program is
   currently running on.
default_line_separator : Text
default_line_separator = Java_System.lineSeparator

## PRIVATE

   The type representing the result of a process.

   Arguments:
   - exit_code: The exit code of the child process.
   - stdout: Any values printed to standard out by the child process.
   - stderr: Any values printed to standard error by the child process.
@Builtin_Type
type System_Process_Result
    System_Process_Result_Data exit_code stdout stderr
