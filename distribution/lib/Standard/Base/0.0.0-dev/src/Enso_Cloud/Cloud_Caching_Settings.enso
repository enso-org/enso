   Sets for how long is Enso Cloud file information cached without checking for
   external updates.

   The default TTL is 60 seconds.

   Side effects from this Enso workflow will invalidate the cache immediately,
   but any external operations (done from other Enso instances) will not be
   visible until a cached value expires. Thus if the workflow is expected to
   co-operate with other workflows, it may be useful to decrease the cache TTL
   or disable it completely by passing `Nothing`.

   Note that completely disabling the caching will affect performance, as some
   generic operations may perform multiple cloud requests.

   Changing the TTL invalidates all existing cache entries, because their
   expiration time was calculated using the old TTL.
set_file_cache_ttl (duration : Duration | Nothing) =
    CacheSettings.setFileCacheTTL duration
    Asset_Cache.invalidate_all

   Returns the current file cache TTL.
get_file_cache_ttl -> Duration | Nothing = CacheSettings.getFileCacheTTL
