## The runtime's integrated monadic state management.
## A container type for functionality for working with the runtime's
   integrated state functionality.

## Executes a stateful computation in a local state environment.

   Arguments:
   - key: The key to associate your local_state with in the environment.
     It is recommended that types be used as keys.
   - local_state: The value to associate with key.
   - computation: The computation to execute in the local state
     environment.

   > Example
     Print a value from the state.

         State.run Integer 0 <| IO.println (State.get Integer)
run : Any -> Any -> Any -> Any
run key local_state ~computation = @Builtin_Method "State.run"

## Returns the current value for the provided key contained in the monadic
   state.

   Arguments:
   - key: The key into the state to get the associated value for.

   Returns an uninitialized state error if the user tries to read from an
   uninitialized slot.

   > Example
     Get the value of state for a key.

         State.get Decimal
get : Any -> Any ! Uninitialized_State
get key = @Builtin_Method "State.get"

## Associates a new_state with the provided key in the runtime's monadic
   state, returning the provided state.

   Arguments:
   - key: The key with which to associate the new state.
   - new_state: The new state to store.

   Returns an uninitialized state error if the user tries to read from an
   uninitialized slot.

   > Example
     Store a new value in the state for a given key.

         State.put Text 2821
put : Any -> Any -> Any ! Uninitialized_State
put key new_state = @Builtin_Method "State.put"
