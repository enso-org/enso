   Places a breakpoint in the program's execution, dropping the user into an
   interactive debugging REPL.

   From the REPL, the user is able to manipulate both the program state and
   its execution in an interactive fashion.

   > Example
     Dropping into a debugging REPL during execution.

        Standard.Base.Runtime.Debug.breakpoint
breakpoint : Nothing
breakpoint = @Builtin_Method "Debug.breakpoint"

## PRIVATE
   ADVANCED
   Evaluates the provided Enso code in the caller frame.

   Arguments:
   - expression: The enso code to evaluate.

   ? Scoping
     The fact that expression is evaluated in the caller frame means that
     it has access to variables in the scope enclosing the call to
     Debug.eval.

   > Example
     Evaluating the expression 1 + 1 and assigning it to a value.

         result = Debug.eval "1 + 1"
eval : Text -> Any
eval expression = @Builtin_Method "Debug.eval"
