    Less than:Any

    ## Is less than or equal to a value (or another column, in case of Table operations)?
    Equal_Or_Less than:Any

    ## Is equal to a value (or another column, in case of Table operations)?
    Equal to:Any

    ## Is greater than or equal to a value (or another column, in case of Table operations)?
    Equal_Or_Greater than:Any

    ## Is greater than a value (or another column, in case of Table operations)?

    ## Is not equal to a value (or another column, in case of Table operations)?
    Not_Equal to:Any

    ## Is between (inclusive) two values (or columns, in case of Table operations)?
    Between lower:Any upper:Any

    ## Does the value start with a prefix (Text only)?

       ? Table Operations
         It accepts a Text value to check if the value contains it. In case of
         Table operations, it can accept another column - then the corresponding
         values from the source column and the provided column are checked.
    Starts_With (prefix : Text | Any) (case_sensitivity:Case_Sensitivity=Case_Sensitivity.Default)

    ## Does the value end with a suffix (Text only)?

       ? Table Operations
         It accepts a Text value to check if the value contains it. In case of
         Table operations, it can accept another column - then the corresponding
         values from the source column and the provided column are checked.
    Ends_With (suffix : Text | Any) (case_sensitivity:Case_Sensitivity=Case_Sensitivity.Default)

    ## Does the value contain the substring (Text only)?

       ? Table Operations
         It accepts a Text value to check if the value contains it. In case of
         Table operations, it can accept another column - then the corresponding
         values from the source column and the provided column are checked.
    Contains (substring : Text | Any) (case_sensitivity:Case_Sensitivity=Case_Sensitivity.Default)

    ## Is the substring not present in the value (Text only)?

       ? Table Operations
         It accepts a Text value to check if the value contains it. In case of
         Table operations, it can accept another column - then the corresponding
         values from the source column and the provided column are checked.
    Not_Contains (substring : Text | Any) (case_sensitivity:Case_Sensitivity=Case_Sensitivity.Default)

    ## Is equal to Nothing?
    Is_Nothing

    ## Is not equal to Nothing?
    Not_Nothing

    ## Is the value equal to True (Boolean only)?
    Is_True

    ## Is the value equal to False (Boolean only)?
    Is_False

    ## Is equal to "" or Nothing (Text only)?
    Is_Empty

    ## Is not equal to "" and Nothing (Text only)?
    Not_Empty

    ## Does the value match the SQL pattern (Text only)?

       The pattern is interpreted according to the standard SQL convention:
       - the `%` character matches any sequence of characters,
       - the `_` character matches any single character,
       - any other character is matched literally.

       ? Table Operations
         It accepts a Text value to check if the value contains it. In case of
         Table operations, it can accept another column - then the corresponding
         values from the source column and the provided column are checked.

       ! Known Limitations.
         The Truffle regex engine does not transparently handle normalization.
         Due to this limitation, Unicode normalization has been disabled for
         this function, so beware that some equivalent graphemes like 'ś' and
         's\u0301' will not be matched.

    Not_Like pattern:Text|Any

    ## Is the value contained in `values`?

       ? Table Operations
         It accepts a `Vector` of values. In case of Table operations, it can
         also accept another column - then it acts as if `column.to_vector` was
         passed - i.e. every element of the original table's column is checked
         if it is contained in the provided column. The columns can have
         different lengths.

         Using Columns can be particularly useful for Database operations, as
         uploading a temporary table and using its column for an `Is_In` check
         will likely be faster than using the vector directly.
    Is_In values:Vector|Any

    ## Is the value not contained in `values`?

       ? Table Operations
