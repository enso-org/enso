## A description of how the regex engine will match on the content.

   This lets you configure how you want to match, from the `First` match only,
   to matching on the `Full` content of the input text.

from Standard.Base import all
from Standard.Base.Data.Text.Matching_Mode import First, Last
from Standard.Base.Data.Text.Matching_Mode export First, Last

type Mode
    ## The regex will make all possible matches.
    All

    ## The regex will only match if the _entire_ text matches.
    Full

    ## The regex will only match within the region defined by start..end.

       Arguments:
       - start: The inclusive start bound of the region.
       - end: The exclusive end bound of the region.
       - mode: The mode to use within the bounded region.

       ! Units
         The `start` and `end` indices range over _characters_ in the text. The
         precise definition of `character` is, for the moment, defined by the
         regular expression engine itself.
    Bounded (start : Integer) (end : Integer) (mode : (First | Integer | All | Full) = All)
