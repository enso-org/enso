## An `Engine` is a configuration and behaviour specification object for a
   particular regular expression engine.

   An implementation of a regular expression engine must implement the below
   interface, as well as conform to the following requirements:

   - The engine must operate in a unicode mode by default, using canonical
     form for equality and the unicode versions of the standard character
     classes.
   - It must support the standard options specified in
     `Standard.Base.Data.Text.Regex.Option`. It may specify additional,
     engine-specific options, but this is not required by the specification.
   - In the defining module, the engine implementation must provide a full
     specification of its syntax in the module documentation block.

   This file is _not executable_. It instead describes the interface for the
   customisable `Engine` and `Pattern` types.

## The `Data.Text.Regex.Engine.Engine` interface.
type Engine

    ## PRIVATE

       Compile the provided `expression` into a regex pattern that can be used
       for matching.

       Arguments
       - expression: The text representing the regular expression that you want
         to compile.
       - options: The options to configure the matching process with. These are
         merged with the specific `engine_opts`.
    compile : Text -> Vector Global_Option.Option -> Pattern ! (Regex.Compile_Error | Invalid_Option_Error)
    compile self _ _ = Errors.unimplemented "This is an interface only."

    ## PRIVATE

       Escape the special characters in `expression` such that the result is a
       valid literal pattern for the original string.

       Arguments:
       - expression: The expression to escape metacharacters in.
    escape : Text -> Text
    escape self _ = Errors.unimplemented "This is an interface only."

## The `Data.Text.Regex.Engine.Pattern` interface.
type Pattern

    ## PRIVATE

       Tries to match the provided `input` against the pattern `self`.

       Arguments:
       - input: The text to match the pattern described by `self` against.
       - mode: The matching mode to use. This must default to `Mode.All`.

       This method will _always_ return `Nothing` if it fails to match.

       ? Return Type
         When asked to match in a mode that can only provide a single match, the
         return type is either a single `Match` object. When asked to match in a
         mode that permits multiple matches, it will always return a `Vector`,
         even if only a single match is found.
    match : Text -> Mode.Mode -> Match | Vector.Vector Match | Nothing
    match self _ _ = Errors.unimplemented "This is an interface only."

    ## PRIVATE

       Returns `True` if the input matches against the pattern described by
       `self`, otherwise `False`.

       Arguments:
       - input: The text to check for matching.
    matches : Text -> Boolean
    matches self _ = Errors.unimplemented "This is an interface only."

    ## PRIVATE

       Tries to find the text in the `input` that matches against the pattern
       `self`.

       Arguments:
       - input: The text to find matches in.
       - mode: The matching mode to use. This must default to `Mode.All`

       This method will _always_ return `Nothing` if it fails to find any
       matches.

       ? Return Type
         When asked to match in a mode that can only provide a single match, the
         return type is either a single `Match` object. When asked to match in a
         mode that permits multiple matches, it will always return a `Vector`,
         even if only a single match is found.
    find : Text -> Mode.Mode -> Text | Vector.Vector Text | Nothing
    find self _ _ = Errors.unimplemented "This is an interface only."

    ## PRIVATE

       Splits the `input` text based on the pattern described by `self`.

       Arguments:
       - input: The text to splut based on the pattern described by `self`.
       - mode: The splitting mode to use. This must default to `Mode.All`.

       This method will _always_ return a vector. If no splits take place, the
       vector will contain a single element.
    split : Text -> (Mode.First | Integer | Mode.All) -> Vector.Vector Text
    split self _ _ = Errors.unimplemented "This is an interface only."

    ## PRIVATE

       Replace all occurrences of the pattern described by `self` in the `input`
       with the specified `replacement`.

       Arguments:
       - input: The text in which to perform the replacement(s).
       - replacement: The literal text with which to replace any matches.
       - mode: The matching mode to use for finding candidates to replace. This
         must default to `Mode.All`.

       If this method performs no replacements it will return the `input` text
       unchanged.
    replace : Text -> Text -> (Mode.First | Integer | Mode.All | Mode.Full) -> Text
    replace self _ _ _ = Errors.unimplemented "This is an interface only."

## The `Data.Text.Regex.Engine.Match` interface.
type Match

    ## PRIVATE

       Gets the text matched by the group with the provided identifier, or
       `Nothing` if the group did not participate in the match. If no such group
       exists for the provided identifier, a `No_Such_Group_Error` is returned.

       Arguments:
       - id: The index or name of that group.

       ? The Full Match
         The group with index 0 is always the full match of the pattern.

       ? Named Groups by Index
         If the regex contained named groups, these may also be accessed by
         index based on their position in the pattern.
    group : Integer | Text -> Text | Nothing ! Regex.No_Such_Group_Error
    group self _ = Errors.unimplemented "This is an interface only."

    ## PRIVATE

       Gets a vector containing the results of _all_ of the capturing groups in
       the pattern, replacing the value of groups that did not participate in
       the match with `default`.

       Arguments:
       - default: The value to return for a given index when the group at that
         index did not participate in the match. The default for this argument
         should be `Nothing`.

       ? The Full Match
         The group with index 0 is always the full match of the pattern.

       ? Named Groups by Index
         If the regex contained named groups, these may also be accessed by
         index based on their position in the pattern.
    groups : (a : Any) -> Vector.Vector (Text | a)
    groups self _ = Errors.unimplemented "This is an interface only."

    ## PRIVATE

       Gets a map containing the named capturing groups for the pattern,
       replacing the value for groups that did not participate in the match with
       `default`.

       Arguments:
       - default: The value to return for a given name when the group at that
         index did not participate in the match. This should default to
         `Nothing`.
    named_groups : (a : Any) -> Map Text (Text | a)
    named_groups self _ = Errors.unimplemented "This is an interface only."

    ## PRIVATE

       Gets the index of the first character captured by the group with the
       given identifier, or `Nothing` if the group did not participate in the
       match.

       Arguments:
       - id: The identifier for the group to fetch the start index for.
    start : Integer | Text -> Integer | Nothing ! Regex.No_Such_Group_Error
    start self _ = Errors.unimplemented "This is an interface only."

    ## PRIVATE

       Gets the index of the first character after `start` that was not captured
       by the group with the given identifier, or `Nothing` if the group did not
       participate in the match.

       Arguments:
       - id: The identifier for the group to fetch the end index for.
    end : Integer | Text -> Integer | Nothing ! Regex.No_Such_Group_Error
    end self _ = Errors.unimplemented "This is an intercace only."

    ## PRIVATE

       Returns the span matched by the group with the provided identifier, or
       `Nothing` if the group did not participate in the match.

       Arguments:
       - id: The identifier for the group to fetch the end index for.
    span : Integer | Text -> Span | Nothing ! Regex.No_Such_Group_Error
    span self _ = Errors.unimplemented "This is an interface only."

    ## PRIVATE

       Returns the start character index of the match's region.
    start_position : Integer
    start_position self = Errors.unimplemented "This is an interface only."

    ## Returns the end character index of the match's region.
    end_position : Integer
    end_position self = Errors.unimplemented "This is an interface only."
