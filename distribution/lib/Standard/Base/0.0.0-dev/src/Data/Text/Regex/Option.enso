## Options are used to configure how a regex engine behaves.

   In this file, Enso provides a set of standard options that must be supported
   by all regex engines integrated with Enso.

type Option

    ## Specifies that all predefined character classes and POSIX character
       classes will match _only_ on ASCII characters.

       ! Performance
         If you are _sure_ that your data can only ever contain characters from
         the ASCII character set, you may be able to obtain a performance boost
         by specifying this flag. This may not be the case on all engines or all
         regexes.
    Ascii_Matching

    ## Specifies that matching should be performed in a case-insensitive manner.
    Case_Insensitive

    ## Specifies that the regular expression should be interpreted in comments
       mode.

       Comments mode has the following changes:
       - Whitespace within the pattern is ignored, except when within a
         character class or when preceeded by an unescaped backslash, or within
         grouping constructs (e.g. `(?...)`).
       - When a line contains a `#`, that is not in a character class and is not
         preceeded by an unescaped backslash, all characters from the leftmost
         such `#` to the end of the line are ignored. That is to say, they act
         as _comments_ in the regex.
    Comments

    ## Specifies that the `.` special character should match everything
       _including_ newline characters. Without this flag, it will match all
       characters _except_ newlines.
    Dot_Matches_Newline

    ## Specifies that the pattern character `^` matches at both the beginning of
       the string and at the beginning of each line (immediately following a
       newline), and that the pattern character `$` matches at the end of each
       line _and_ at the end of the string.
