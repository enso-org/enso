## The `Data.Text.Regex.Engine.Pattern` interface.
type Pattern

    ## PRIVATE

       Tries to match the provided `input` against the pattern `self`.

       Arguments:
       - input: The text to match the pattern described by `self` against.
       - mode: The matching mode to use. This must default to `Regex_Mode.All`.

       This method will _always_ return `Nothing` if it fails to match.

       ? Return Type
         When asked to match in a mode that can only provide a single match, the
         return type is either a single `Match` object. When asked to match in a
         mode that permits multiple matches, it will always return a `Vector`,
         even if only a single match is found.
    match : Text -> (Regex_Mode | Matching_Mode) -> Match | Vector Match | Nothing
    match self _ _ = Unimplemented.throw "This is an interface only."

    ## PRIVATE

       Returns `True` if the input matches against the pattern described by
       `self`, otherwise `False`.

       Arguments:
       - input: The text to check for matching.
    matches : Text -> Boolean
    matches self _ = Unimplemented.throw "This is an interface only."

    ## PRIVATE

       Tries to find the text in the `input` that matches against the pattern
       `self`.

       Arguments:
       - input: The text to find matches in.
       - mode: The matching mode to use. This must default to `Regex_Mode.All`

       This method will _always_ return `Nothing` if it fails to find any
       matches.

       ? Return Type
         When asked to match in a mode that can only provide a single match, the
         return type is either a single `Match` object. When asked to match in a
         mode that permits multiple matches, it will always return a `Vector`,
         even if only a single match is found.
    find : Text -> (Regex_Mode | Matching_Mode) -> Text | Vector Text | Nothing
    find self _ _ = Unimplemented.throw "This is an interface only."

    ## PRIVATE

       Splits the `input` text based on the pattern described by `self`.

       Arguments:
       - input: The text to split based on the pattern described by `self`.
       - mode: The splitting mode to use. This must default to `Regex_Mode.All`.

       This method will _always_ return a vector. If no splits take place, the
       vector will contain a single element.
    split : Text -> (Matching_Mode | Integer | Regex_Mode) -> Vector Text
    split self _ _ = Unimplemented.throw "This is an interface only."

    ## PRIVATE

       Replace all occurrences of the pattern described by `self` in the `input`
       with the specified `replacement`.

       Arguments:
       - input: The text in which to perform the replacement(s).
       - replacement: The literal text with which to replace any matches.
       - mode: The matching mode to use for finding candidates to replace. This
         must default to `Regex_Mode.All`.

       If this method performs no replacements it will return the `input` text
       unchanged.
    replace : Text -> Text -> Regex_Mode | Matching_Mode | Integer -> Text
    replace self _ _ _ = Unimplemented.throw "This is an interface only."
