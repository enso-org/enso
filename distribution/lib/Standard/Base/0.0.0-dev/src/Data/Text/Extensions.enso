## UNSTABLE

   An error for when an index is out of bounds in a text.

   Arguments:
   - index: The requested index in the text.
   - length: The length of the text.
type Index_Out_Of_Bounds_Error index length

## ALIAS Length

   Computes the number of characters in the text.

   ! What is a Character?
     A character is defined as an Extended Grapheme Cluster, see Unicode
     Standard Annex 29. This is the smallest unit that still has semantic
     meaning in most text-processing applications.

   > Example
     Getting the length of the string "건반(Korean)".

         "건반(Korean)".length
Text.length : Integer
Text.length =
    iterator = BreakIterator.getCharacterInstance
    iterator.setText this

    count accum iter = if iter == -1 then accum else
        @Tail_Call count (accum + 1) iterator.next
    count 0 iterator.next

## Returns a new `Text` object with the characters in the reverse order of the input.

   ! What is a Character?
     A character is defined as an Extended Grapheme Cluster, see Unicode
     Standard Annex 29. This is the smallest unit that still has semantic
     meaning in most text-processing applications.

   > Example
     Reverse the text "Hello, world!".

         "Hello, world!".reverse
Text.reverse : Text
Text.reverse =
    reverseStringBuilder = StringBuilder.new this.length
    iterator = BreakIterator.getCharacterInstance
    iterator.setText this

    iterate prev next = if next == -1 then reverseStringBuilder.toString else
      reverseStringBuilder.append (Text_Utils.substring this next prev)
      @Tail_Call iterate next iterator.previous
    iterate iterator.last iterator.previous

## Applies the provided `function` to each character in `this`.

   Arguments:
   - function: The operation to apply to each character in the text.

         "aaa".each IO.println
Text.each : (Text -> Any) -> Nothing
Text.each function =
    iterator = BreakIterator.getCharacterInstance
    iterator.setText this

    iterate prev nxt = if nxt == -1 then Nothing else
        function (Text_Utils.substring this prev nxt)
        @Tail_Call iterate nxt iterator.next
    iterate iterator.first iterator.next

## ALIAS Get Character

   Returns a character from the text at the specified index (0-based).

   Arguments:
     - index: The location in the text to get the character from. The
       index is also allowed be negative, then the characters are
       counted from the end of the text, i.e. -1 will correspond to the
       last character.

     Get the individual characters in the text "건반(Korean)".

         "건반(Korean)".at 1 == "반"
Text.at : Integer -> Text ! Index_Out_Of_Bounds_Error
Text.at index =
    case index < 0 of
        True ->
            length = this.length
            new_index = index + length
            if new_index < 0 then Error.throw (Index_Out_Of_Bounds_Error index length) else
                this.at new_index
        False ->
            iterator = BreakIterator.getCharacterInstance

                Text_Utils.substring this first next

## ALIAS Get Characters

   Returns a vector containing all characters in the given text.

   ! What is a Character?
     A character is defined as an Extended Grapheme Cluster, see Unicode
     Standard Annex 29. This is the smallest unit that still has semantic
     meaning in most text-processing applications.

   > Example
     Get the individual characters in the text "건반(Korean)".

         "건반(Korean)".characters
Text.characters : Vector.Vector Text
Text.characters =
    bldr = Vector.new_builder
    this.each bldr.append
    bldr.to_vector

## ALIAS Match Text

   Matches the text in `this` against the provided regex `pattern`, returning
   the match(es) if present or `Nothing` if there are no matches.

   Arguments:
   - pattern: The pattern to match `this` against. We recommend using _raw text_
     to write your patterns.
   - mode: This argument specifies how many matches the engine will try and
     find. When mode is set to either `Mode.First` or `Mode.Full`, this method
     will return either a single `Match` or `Nothing`. If set to an `Integer` or
     `Mode.All`, this method will return either a `Vector Match` or `Nothing`.
   - match_ascii: Enables or disables pure-ASCII matching for the regex. If you
     know your data only contains ASCII then you can enable this for a
     performance boost on some regex engines.
   - case_insensitive: Enables or disables case-insensitive matching. Case
     insensitive matching behaves as if it normalises the case of all input
     text before matching on it.
   - dot_matches_newline: Enables or disables the dot matches newline option.
     This specifies that the `.` special character should match everything
     _including_ newline characters. Without this flag, it will match all
     characters _except_ newlines.
   - multiline: Enables or disables the multiline option. Multiline specifies
     that the `^` and `$` pattern characters match the start and end of lines,
     as well as the start and end of the input respectively.
   - comments: Enables or disables the comments mode for the regular expression.
     In comments mode, the following changes apply:
     - Whitespace within the pattern is ignored, except when within a
       character class or when preceeded by an unescaped backslash, or within
       grouping constructs (e.g. `(?...)`).
     - When a line contains a `#`, that is not in a character class and is not
       preceeded by an unescaped backslash, all characters from the leftmost
       such `#` to the end of the line are ignored. That is to say, they act
       as _comments_ in the regex.
   - extra_opts: Specifies additional options in a vector. This allows options
     to be supplied and computed without having to break them out into arguments
     to the function. Where these overlap with one of the flags (`match_ascii`,
     `case_insensitive`, `dot_matches_newline`, `multiline` and `verbose`), the
     flags take precedence.

   ! Boolean Flags and Extra Options
     This function contains a number of arguments that are boolean flags that
     enable or disable common options for the regex. At the same time, it also
     provides the ability to specify options in the `extra_opts` argument.

     Where one of the flags is _set_ (has the value `True` or `False`), the
     value of the flag takes precedence over the value in `extra_opts` when
     merging the options to the engine. The flags are _unset_ (have value
     `Nothing`) by default.

   > Example
     Find matches for a basic email regex in some text. NOTE: This regex is
     _not_ compliant with RFC 5322.

         example_match =
             regex = ".+@.+"
             "contact@enso.org".match regex

    compiled_pattern = Regex.compile pattern match_ascii=match_ascii case_insensitive=case_insensitive dot_matches_newline=dot_matches_newline multiline=multiline comments=comments extra_opts=extra_opts
    compiled_pattern.match this mode

## ALIAS Check Matches

   Matches the text in `this` against the provided regex `pattern`, returning
   `True` if the text matches at least once, and `False` otherwise.

   Arguments:
   - pattern: The pattern to match `this` against. We recommend using _raw text_
     to write your patterns.
   - mode: This argument specifies how many matches the engine will try and
     find. When mode is set to either `Mode.First` or `Mode.Full`, this method
     will return either a single `Match` or `Nothing`. If set to an `Integer` or
     `Mode.All`, this method will return either a `Vector Match` or `Nothing`.
   - match_ascii: Enables or disables pure-ASCII matching for the regex. If you
     know your data only contains ASCII then you can enable this for a
     performance boost on some regex engines.
   - case_insensitive: Enables or disables case-insensitive matching. Case
     insensitive matching behaves as if it normalises the case of all input
     text before matching on it.
   - dot_matches_newline: Enables or disables the dot matches newline option.
     This specifies that the `.` special character should match everything
     _including_ newline characters. Without this flag, it will match all
     characters _except_ newlines.
   - multiline: Enables or disables the multiline option. Multiline specifies
     that the `^` and `$` pattern characters match the start and end of lines,
     as well as the start and end of the input respectively.
   - comments: Enables or disables the comments mode for the regular expression.
     In comments mode, the following changes apply:
     - Whitespace within the pattern is ignored, except when within a
       character class or when preceeded by an unescaped backslash, or within
       grouping constructs (e.g. `(?...)`).
     - When a line contains a `#`, that is not in a character class and is not
       preceeded by an unescaped backslash, all characters from the leftmost
       such `#` to the end of the line are ignored. That is to say, they act
       as _comments_ in the regex.
   - extra_opts: Specifies additional options in a vector. This allows options
     to be supplied and computed without having to break them out into arguments
     to the function. Where these overlap with one of the flags (`match_ascii`,
     `case_insensitive`, `dot_matches_newline`, `multiline` and `verbose`), the
     flags take precedence.

   ! Boolean Flags and Extra Options
     This function contains a number of arguments that are boolean flags that
     enable or disable common options for the regex. At the same time, it also
     provides the ability to specify options in the `extra_opts` argument.

     Where one of the flags is _set_ (has the value `True` or `False`), the

     merging the options to the engine. The flags are _unset_ (have value
     `Nothing`) by default.

    compiled_pattern = Regex.compile pattern match_ascii=match_ascii case_insensitive=case_insensitive dot_matches_newline=dot_matches_newline multiline=multiline comments=comments extra_opts=extra_opts
    compiled_pattern.matches this

## ALIAS Find Text

   Finds all occurrences of `pattern` in the text `this`, returning the text(s)
   if present, or `Nothing` if there are no matches.

   Arguments:
   - pattern: The pattern to match `this` against. We recommend using _raw text_
     to write your patterns.
   - mode: This argument specifies how many matches the engine will try and
     find. When mode is set to either `Mode.First` or `Mode.Full`, this method
     will return either a single `Text` or `Nothing`. If set to an `Integer` or
     `Mode.All`, this method will return either a `Vector Text` or `Nothing`.
   - match_ascii: Enables or disables pure-ASCII matching for the regex. If you
     know your data only contains ASCII then you can enable this for a
     performance boost on some regex engines.
   - case_insensitive: Enables or disables case-insensitive matching. Case
     insensitive matching behaves as if it normalises the case of all input
     text before matching on it.
   - dot_matches_newline: Enables or disables the dot matches newline option.
     This specifies that the `.` special character should match everything
     _including_ newline characters. Without this flag, it will match all
     characters _except_ newlines.
   - multiline: Enables or disables the multiline option. Multiline specifies
     that the `^` and `$` pattern characters match the start and end of lines,
     as well as the start and end of the input respectively.
   - comments: Enables or disables the comments mode for the regular expression.
     In comments mode, the following changes apply:
     - Whitespace within the pattern is ignored, except when within a
       character class or when preceeded by an unescaped backslash, or within
       grouping constructs (e.g. `(?...)`).
     - When a line contains a `#`, that is not in a character class and is not
       preceeded by an unescaped backslash, all characters from the leftmost
       such `#` to the end of the line are ignored. That is to say, they act
       as _comments_ in the regex.
   - extra_opts: Specifies additional options in a vector. This allows options
     to be supplied and computed without having to break them out into arguments
     to the function. Where these overlap with one of the flags (`match_ascii`,
     `case_insensitive`, `dot_matches_newline`, `multiline` and `verbose`), the
     flags take precedence.

   ! Boolean Flags and Extra Options
     This function contains a number of arguments that are boolean flags that
     enable or disable common options for the regex. At the same time, it also
     provides the ability to specify options in the `extra_opts` argument.

     merging the options to the engine. The flags are _unset_ (have value
     `Nothing`) by default.

         example_find =
             text = "Now I know my ABCs"
             text.find "\w{1,3}"

    compiled_pattern.find this mode

## ALIAS Split Text

   Takes a separator and returns the vector that results from splitting `this`
   on the configured number of occurrences of `separator`.

   Arguments:
   - separator: The pattern used to split the text.
   - mode: This argument specifies how many matches the engine will try and
     find. When mode is set to either `Mode.First` or `Mode.Full`, this method
     will return either a single `Text` or `Nothing`. If set to an `Integer` or
     `Mode.All`, this method will return either a `Vector Text` or `Nothing`.
   - match_ascii: Enables or disables pure-ASCII matching for the regex. If you
     know your data only contains ASCII then you can enable this for a
     performance boost on some regex engines.
   - case_insensitive: Enables or disables case-insensitive matching. Case
     insensitive matching behaves as if it normalises the case of all input
     text before matching on it.
   - dot_matches_newline: Enables or disables the dot matches newline option.
     This specifies that the `.` special character should match everything
     _including_ newline characters. Without this flag, it will match all
     characters _except_ newlines.
   - multiline: Enables or disables the multiline option. Multiline specifies
     that the `^` and `$` pattern characters match the start and end of lines,
     as well as the start and end of the input respectively.
   - verbose: Enables or disables the verbose mode for the regular expression.
     In verbose mode, the following changes apply:
     - Whitespace within the pattern is ignored, except when within a
       character class or when preceeded by an unescaped backslash, or within
       grouping constructs (e.g. `(?...)`).
     - When a line contains a `#`, that is not in a character class and is not
       preceeded by an unescaped backslash, all characters from the leftmost
       such `#` to the end of the line are ignored. That is to say, they act
       as _comments_ in the regex.
   - extra_opts: Specifies additional options in a vector. This allows options
     to be supplied and computed without having to break them out into arguments
     to the function. Where these overlap with one of the flags (`match_ascii`,
     `case_insensitive`, `dot_matches_newline`, `multiline` and `verbose`), the

     `Nothing`) by default.

   > Example
     Split the comma-separated text into a vector of items.

         "ham,eggs,cheese,tomatoes".split ","

## ALIAS Replace Text

   Replaces each occurrence of `old_sequence` with `new_sequence`, returning
   `this` unchanged if no matches are found.

   Arguments:
   - old_sequence: The pattern to search for in `this`.
   - new_sequence: The text to replace every occurrence of `old_sequence` with.
   - mode: This argument specifies how many matches the engine will try to
     replace.
   - match_ascii: Enables or disables pure-ASCII matching for the regex. If you
     know your data only contains ASCII then you can enable this for a
     performance boost on some regex engines.
   - case_insensitive: Enables or disables case-insensitive matching. Case

     In comments mode, the following changes apply:
     - Whitespace within the pattern is ignored, except when within a
       character class or when preceeded by an unescaped backslash, or within
       grouping constructs (e.g. `(?...)`).
     - When a line contains a `#`, that is not in a character class and is not

## ALIAS Get Words

   Returns a vector containing all words in the given text.

   Arguments:
   - keep_whitespace: Whether or not the whitespace around the words should be
     preserved. If set to `True`, the whitespace will be included as a "word" in
     the output.

   ! What is a Word?
     A word is defined based on the definition of Word Boundaries in the Unicode
     Standard Annex 29, supplemented by language-specific dictionaries for
     Chinese, Japanese, Thai, and Khmer.

   > Example
     Getting the words in the sentence "I have not one, but two cats."

        "I have not one, but two cats.".words
Text.words : Boolean -> Vector.Vector Text
Text.words keep_whitespace=False =
    iterator = BreakIterator.getWordInstance
    iterator.setText this
    bldr = Vector.new_builder
    fst = iterator.first
    nxt = iterator.next

    build prev nxt = if nxt == -1 then Nothing else
        word = Text_Utils.substring this prev nxt
        word_not_whitespace = (Text_Utils.is_all_whitespace word).not
        if word_not_whitespace then bldr.append word else
            if keep_whitespace then
                bldr.append word

        next_nxt = iterator.next
        @Tail_Call build nxt next_nxt

    build fst nxt

    bldr.to_vector

## Checks whether `this` is equal to `that`.

   Arguments:
   - that: The text to compare `this` for equality with.

   ! Unicode Equality
     The definition of equality includes Unicode canonicalization. I.e. two
     texts are equal if they are identical after canonical decomposition. This
     ensures that different ways of expressing the same character in the
     underlying binary representation are considered equal.

   > Example
     The string 'é' (i.e. the character U+00E9, LATIN SMALL LETTER E WITH ACUTE)
     is canonically the same as the string 'e\u0301' (i.e. the letter `e`
     followed by U+0301, COMBINING ACUTE ACCENT). Therefore:

         ('é' == 'e\u0301') == True
Text.== : Any -> Boolean
Text.== that = if Meta.is_same_object this Text then Meta.is_same_object that Text else
    Text_Utils.equals this that

## Checks whether `this` is equal to `that`, ignoring the case of the texts.

   Arguments:
   - that: The text to compare `this` for case-insensitive equality with.

   Two texts are considered equal ignoring case if they are of the same length
   and corresponding characters are equal ignoring case.

   ! Unicode Equality
     The definition of equality includes Unicode canonicalization. I.e. two
     texts are equal if they are identical after canonical decomposition. This
     ensures that different ways of expressing the same character in the
     underlying binary representation are considered equal.

   > Example
     The string 'É' (i.e. the character U+00C9, LATIN CAPITAL LETTER E WITH
     ACUTE) is equal ignore case to the string 'é' (i.e. the character U+00E9,
     LATIN SMALL LETTER E WITH ACUTE), which is canonically the same as the
     string 'e\u0301' (i.e. the letter `e` followed by U+0301, COMBINING ACUTE
     ACCENT). Therefore:

         (('É' . equals_ignore_case 'é') && ('é' . equals_ignore_case 'e\u0301')) == True
Text.equals_ignore_case : Text -> Locale -> Boolean
Text.equals_ignore_case that locale=Locale.default =
    Text_Utils.equals_ignore_case this that locale.java_locale

## ADVANCED
   PRIVATE
   UNSTABLE
   Unifies the case of all letters in the text, generating a key which can be
   used to perform case-insensitive comparisons.
Text.to_case_insensitive_key : Locale -> Text
Text.to_case_insensitive_key locale=Locale.default =
    Text_Utils.case_insensitive_key this locale.java_locale

## Compare two texts to discover their ordering.

   Arguments:
   - that: The text to order `this` with respect to.

   > Example
     Checking how "a" orders in relation to "b".

         "a".compare_to "b"
Text.compare_to : Text -> Ordering
Text.compare_to that =
    comparison_result = Text_Utils.compare_normalized this that
    if comparison_result == 0 then Ordering.Equal else
        if comparison_result < 0 then Ordering.Less else
            Ordering.Greater

## ALIAS Check Emptiness

   Check if `this` is empty.

   ! What is Empty?
     Text is considered to be empty when its length is zero.

   > Example
     Check if the text "aaa" is empty.

         "aaa".is_empty
Text.is_empty : Boolean
Text.is_empty = this == ""

## ALIAS Check Non-Emptiness

   Check if `this` is not empty.

   ! What is Not Empty?
     Text is considered to be not empty when its length is greater than zero.

   > Example
     Check if the text "aaa" is not empty.

         "aaa".not_empty
Text.not_empty : Boolean
Text.not_empty = this.is_empty.not

## Inserts text value at the specified index.

   Arguments:
     - index: The position (0-based) in the text to inset text at.
       When the index is non-negative the text is inserted before the
       specified position.
       When the index is negative, then the characters are counted from
       the end of the text and the text is inserted after the specified
       position, i.e. -1 will insert the text after the last character.

   ! What is a Character?
     A character is defined as an Extended Grapheme Cluster, see Unicode
     Standard Annex 29. This is the smallest unit that still has semantic
     meaning in most text-processing applications.

   > Example
    Insert text at a specified index

         "Hello World!".insert 0 " Cruel" == " CruelHello World!"
         "Hello World!".insert 5 " Cruel" == "Hello Cruel World!"
         "Hello World!".insert -1 " Cruel" == "Hello World! Cruel"
Text.insert : Integer -> Text -> Text ! Index_Out_Of_Bounds_Error
Text.insert index that =
    len = this.length
    idx = if index < 0 then len + index + 1 else index
    if (idx < 0) || (idx > len) then Error.throw (Index_Out_Of_Bounds_Error index len) else
        if idx == 0 then that + this else
            if idx == len then this + that else
                pre = this.take (Range 0 idx)
                post = this.take (Range idx len)
                pre + that + post

## Returns if a character from the text at the specified index (0-based) is a
   digit (0-9).

   Arguments:
     - index: The location in the text to get the character from. The
       index is also allowed to be negative, then the characters are
       counted from the end of the text, i.e. -1 will correspond to the
       last character.

   ! What is a Character?
     A character is defined as an Extended Grapheme Cluster, see Unicode
     Standard Annex 29. This is the smallest unit that still has semantic
     meaning in most text-processing applications.

   > Example
     Check if an individual character is a digit:

         "0".is_digit == True
         "A0".is_digit == False
         "A0".is_digit 1 == True
         "건반(Korean)".is_digit 1 == False
Text.is_digit : Integer -> Boolean ! Index_Out_Of_Bounds_Error
Text.is_digit (index=0) =
    grapheme = this.at index
    char = (Text_Utils.get_chars grapheme).at 0
    char>=48 && char<=57

## Checks if the text consists only of whitespace characters.

   > Example
     Check if a text is whitespace only.

         ' \t'.is_whitespace == True
         "0 ".is_whitespace == False
Text.is_whitespace : Boolean
Text.is_whitespace =
    Text_Utils.is_all_whitespace this

## Returns a vector containing bytes representing the UTF-8 encoding of the
   input text.

   This is useful for low-level operations, such as binary data encoding and
   decoding.

   > Example
     Get the UTF-8 bytes of the text "Hello".

         "Hello".utf_8
Text.utf_8 : Vector.Vector Byte
Text.utf_8 = Vector.Vector (Text_Utils.get_bytes this)

## Takes a vector of bytes and returns Text resulting from decoding it as UTF-8.

   Arguments:
   - bytes: The vector of UTF-8 bytes.

   This is useful for low-level operations, such as binary data encoding and
   decoding.

   > Example
     Decoding the bytes to get a text.

         Text.from_utf_8 [-32, -92, -107, -32, -91, -115, -32, -92, -73, -32, -92, -65]
Text.from_utf_8 : Vector.Vector Byte -> Text
Text.from_utf_8 bytes = Text_Utils.from_utf_8 bytes.to_array

## ADVANCED

   Returns a vector containing the UTF-16 characters that encode the input text.

   This is useful for low-level operations, such as binary data encoding and
   decoding.

   > Example
     Get the UTF-16 bytes of the text "Hello".

         "Hello".utf_16
Text.utf_16 : Vector.Vector Integer
Text.utf_16 = Vector.Vector (Text_Utils.get_chars this)

## ADVANCED

   Takes a vector of UTF-16 characters and returns the text that results from
   decoding it as UTF-16.

   Arguments:
   - chars: The vector of UTF-16 characters.

   This is useful for low-level operations, such as binary data encoding and
   decoding.
Text.from_utf_16 : Vector.Vector Integer -> Text
Text.from_utf_16 chars = Text_Utils.from_chars chars.to_array

## Returns a vector containing integers representing the Unicode codepoints of
   the input text.

   This is useful for low-level operations, such as binary data encoding and
   decoding.

   > Example
     Get the codepoints of the text "Hello".

         "Hello".codepoints
Text.codepoints : Vector.Vector Integer
Text.codepoints = Vector.Vector (Text_Utils.get_codepoints this)

## Takes an array of numbers and returns the text resulting from interpreting it
   as a sequence of Unicode codepoints.

   This is useful for low-level operations, such as binary data encoding and
   decoding.

   > Example
     Converting a vector of codepoints back into a text.
         Text.from_codepoints [129318, 127996, 8205, 9794, 65039]
Text.from_codepoints : Vector.Vector Integer -> Text
Text.from_codepoints codepoints = Text_Utils.from_codepoints codepoints.to_array

## ALIAS Check Prefix

   Checks whether `this` starts with `prefix`.

   Arguments:
   - prefix: The prefix to see if `this` starts with.
   - matcher: If a `Text_Matcher`, the text is compared using case-sensitivity
     rules specified in the matcher.
     If a `Regex_Matcher`, the term is used as a regular expression and matched
     using the associated options.

   ! Unicode Equality
     The definition of equality includes Unicode canonicalization. I.e. two
     texts are equal if they are identical after canonical decomposition. This
     ensures that different ways of expressing the same character in the
     underlying binary representation are considered equal.

     This however is not always well handled by the regex engine. The behaviour
     is as follows:

         'ś' . starts_with 's' == False
         's\u{301}' . starts_with 's' == False
         's\u{301}' . starts_with 'ś' == True

        compiled_pattern = matcher.compile preprocessed_pattern
        match = compiled_pattern.match this Mode.First
        match.is_nothing.not

## ALIAS Check Suffix

   Checks whether `this` ends with `suffix`.

   Arguments:
   - suffix: The suffix to see if `this` ends with.
   - matcher: If a `Text_Matcher`, the text is compared using case-sensitivity
     rules specified in the matcher.
     If a `Regex_Matcher`, the term is used as a regular expression and matched
     using the associated options.

         "Hello World".ends_with "World" == True
         "Hello World".ends_with "world" == False
         "Hello World".ends_with "world" (Text_Matcher Case_Insensitive.new) == True

## ALIAS lower, upper, title, proper
   Converts each character in `this` to the specified case.

   Arguments:
   - case_option: specifies how to convert the characters.
   - locale: specifies the locale for character case mapping. Defaults to
     `Locale.default`.

   ! What is a Character?
     A character is defined as an Extended Grapheme Cluster, see Unicode
     Standard Annex 29. This is the smallest unit that still has semantic
     meaning in most text-processing applications.

   ! What is title case?
     Title case capitalizes the first letter of every word and ensures that all
     the remaining letters are in lower case. Some definitions of title case
     avoid capitalizing minor words (like the article "the" in English) but this
     implementation treats all words in the same way.

   > Example
     Converting a text to lower case in the default locale:

         "My TeXt!".to_case == "my text!"

   > Example
     Converting a text to upper case in a specified locale:

         from Standard.Base import all
         import Standard.Base.Data.Locale

         example_case_with_locale = "i".to_case Upper (Locale.new "tr") == "İ"
Text.to_case : Case -> Locale -> Text
Text.to_case case_option=Case.Lower locale=Locale.Default = case case_option of
    Case.Lower -> UCharacter.toLowerCase locale.java_locale this
    Case.Upper -> UCharacter.toUpperCase locale.java_locale this
    Case.Title -> UCharacter.toTitleCase locale.java_locale this Nothing

## Returns the input padded to the specified `length`, using the `with_pad`
   string repeated at the start or the end.

   Arguments:
   - length: The new length for the output. The result is the original string if
     the input length is more than length.
   - with_pad: The string to use to pad the input. If the last repetition
     exceeds the target length, it is truncated to the required size. If padding
     at the `End`, the beginning of the padding string is used and if padding at
     `Start`, the end of the string is used.
   - at: The location of where to pad the input.

   > Example
     Padding a text with whitespace at the end.

         "Hello World!".pad 15 == "Hello World!   "

   > Example
     Behavior of padding if the `with_pad` string has to be truncated.

         "HELLO".pad 9 "AB" == "HELLOABAB"
         "HELLO".pad 8 "AB" == "HELLOABA"

## This function removes the specified `trim_characters`, by default any
   whitespace, from the start, the end, or both ends of the input.

   Arguments:
   - trim_characters: A Text containing characters that should be removed or a
     predicate taking single character strings and specifying if they should be
     removed. By default, this should be any Unicode whitespace characters and
     all line terminator characters.
   - from: The location of where to trim the input. By default, this function
     trims both ends of the input.

   > Example
     Trimming whitespace from a string.

         " Hello! ".trim == "Hello!"
         " Hello! ".trim Start == "Hello! "
         " Hello! ".trim End == " Hello!"

   > Example
     Trimming a specific set of letters from a string.

        "ABC123".trim Start "ABC" == "123"
        "ABBA123".trim Start "ABC" == "123"

## ALIAS find, index_of, position_of, span_of
   Find the location of the `term` in the input.
   Returns a Span representing the location at which the term was found, or
   `Nothing` if the term was not found in the input.

   Arguments:
   - term: The term to find.
   - mode: Specifies if the first or last occurrence of the term should be
     returned if there are multiple occurrences within the input. The first
     occurrence is returned by default.
   - matcher: Specifies how the term is matched against the input:
     - If a `Text_Matcher`, the text is compared using case-sensitively rules
       specified in the matcher.
     - If a `Regex_Matcher`, the `term` is used as a regular expression and
       matched using the associated options.

   ! What is a Character?
     A character is defined as an Extended Grapheme Cluster, see Unicode
     Standard Annex 29. This is the smallest unit that still has semantic
     meaning in most text-processing applications.

   > Example
     Finding location of a substring.

         "Hello World!".location_of "J" == Nothing
         "Hello World!".location_of "o" == Span (Range 4 5) "Hello World!"
         "Hello World!".location_of "o" mode=Matching_Mode.Last == Span (Range 7 8) "Hello World!"

   ! Match Length
     The  function returns not only the index of the match but a `Span` instance
     which contains both the start and end indices, allowing to determine the
     length of the match. This is useful not only with regex matches (where a
     regular expression can have matches of various lengths) but also for case
     insensitive matching. In case insensitive mode, a single character can
     match multiple characters, for example `ß` will match `ss` and `SS`, and
     the ligature `ﬃ` will match `ffi` or `f` etc. Thus in case insensitive
     mode, the length of the match can be shorter or longer than the term that
     was being matched, so it is extremely important to not rely on the length
     of the matched term when analysing the matches as they may have different
     lengths.

   > Example
     Match length differences in case insensitive matching.

         term = "straße"
         text = "MONUMENTENSTRASSE 42"
         match = text . location_of term matcher=(Text_Matcher Case_Insensitive.new)
         term.length == 6
         match.length == 7

   ! Matching Grapheme Clusters
     In case insensitive mode, a single character can match multiple characters,
     for example `ß` will match `ss` and `SS`, and the ligature `ﬃ` will match
     `ffi` or `f` etc. Thus in this mode, it is sometimes possible for a term to
     match only a part of some single grapheme cluster, for example in the text
     `ﬃa` the term `ia` will match just one-third of the first grapheme `ﬃ`.
     Since we do not have the resolution to distinguish such partial matches
     (as that would require non-integer indices), so a match which matched just
     a part of some grapheme cluster is extended and treated as if it matched
     the whole grapheme cluster.

   > Example
     Extending matches to full grapheme clusters.

         ligatures = "ﬃﬄ"
         ligatures.length == 2
         term_1 = "IFF"
         match_1 = ligatures . location_of term_1 matcher=(Text_Matcher Case_Insensitive.new)
         term_1.length == 3
         match_1.length == 2
         term_2 = "ffiffl"
         match_2 = ligatures . location_of term_2 matcher=(Text_Matcher Case_Insensitive.new)
         term_2.length == 6
         match_2.length == 2
         # After being extended to full grapheme clusters, both terms "IFF" and "ffiffl" match the same span of grapheme clusters.
         match_1 == match_2

## ALIAS find_all, index_of_all, position_of_all, span_of_all
   Finds all the locations of the `term` in the input.
   If not found, the function returns an empty Vector.

   Arguments:
   - term: The term to find.
   - matcher: Specifies how the term is matched against the input:
     - If a `Text_Matcher`, the text is compared using case-sensitively rules
       specified in the matcher.
     - If a `Regex_Matcher`, the `term` is used as a regular expression and
       matched using the associated options.
