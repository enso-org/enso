## UNSTABLE

   An error for when an index is out of bounds in a text.

   Arguments:
   - index: The requested index in the text.
   - length: The length of the text.
type Index_Out_Of_Bounds_Error index length

## ALIAS Length

   Computes the number of characters in the text.

   ! What is a Character?
     A character is defined as an Extended Grapheme Cluster, see Unicode
     Standard Annex 29. This is the smallest unit that still has semantic
     meaning in most text-processing applications.

   > Example
     Getting the length of the string "건반(Korean)".

         "건반(Korean)".length
Text.length : Integer
Text.length =
    iterator = BreakIterator.getCharacterInstance
    iterator.setText this
    nxt = iterator.next

    count accum iter = if iter == -1 then accum else
        counter = accum + 1
        next_nxt = iterator.next
        @Tail_Call count counter next_nxt
    count 0 nxt

## Applies the provided `function` to each character in `this`.

   Arguments:
   - function: The operation to apply to each character in the text.

     A character is defined as an Extended Grapheme Cluster, see Unicode
     Standard Annex 29. This is the smallest unit that still has semantic
     meaning in most text-processing applications.

   > Example
     Print each character in the text "aaa".

         "aaa".each IO.println
Text.each : (Text -> Any) -> Nothing
Text.each function =
    iterator = BreakIterator.getCharacterInstance

        next_nxt = iterator.next
        @Tail_Call iterate nxt next_nxt
    iterate fst nxt
    Nothing

## ALIAS Get Character

   Returns a character from the text at the specified index (0-based).

   Arguments:
     - index: The location in the text to get the character from. The
       index is also allowed be negative, then the characters are
       counted from the end of the text, i.e. -1 will correspond to the
       last character.

   ! What is a Character?
     A character is defined as an Extended Grapheme Cluster, see Unicode
     Standard Annex 29. This is the smallest unit that still has semantic
     meaning in most text-processing applications.

   > Example
     Get the individual characters in the text "건반(Korean)".

         "건반(Korean)".at 1 == "반"
Text.at : Integer -> Text ! Index_Out_Of_Bounds_Error
Text.at index =
    case index < 0 of
        True ->
            length = this.length
            new_index = index + length
            if new_index < 0 then Error.throw (Index_Out_Of_Bounds_Error index length) else
                this.at new_index
        False ->
            iterator = BreakIterator.getCharacterInstance
            iterator.setText this

            loop prev next count = if count == index then (Text_Utils.substring this prev next) else
                next_next = iterator.next
                if next_next == -1 then count else
                    @Tail_Call loop next next_next (count + 1)

            first = iterator.next
            result = if (first == -1) then 0 else (loop 0 first 0)
            case result of
                Integer -> Error.throw (Index_Out_Of_Bounds_Error index result)
                _ -> result

## ALIAS Get Characters

   Returns a vector containing all characters in the given text.

   ! What is a Character?
     A character is defined as an Extended Grapheme Cluster, see Unicode
     Standard Annex 29. This is the smallest unit that still has semantic
     meaning in most text-processing applications.

   > Example
     Get the individual characters in the text "건반(Korean)".

         "건반(Korean)".characters
Text.characters : Vector.Vector Text
Text.characters =
    bldr = Vector.new_builder
    this.each bldr.append
    bldr.to_vector

## ALIAS Match Text

   Matches the text in `this` against the provided regex `pattern`, returning
   the match(es) if present or `Nothing` if there are no matches.

   Arguments:
   - pattern: The pattern to match `this` against. We recommend using _raw text_
     to write your patterns.
   - mode: This argument specifies how many matches the engine will try and
     find. When mode is set to either `Mode.First` or `Mode.Full`, this method
     will return either a single `Match` or `Nothing`. If set to an `Integer` or
     `Mode.All`, this method will return either a `Vector Match` or `Nothing`.
   - match_ascii: Enables or disables pure-ASCII matching for the regex. If you
     know your data only contains ASCII then you can enable this for a
     performance boost on some regex engines.
   - case_insensitive: Enables or disables case-insensitive matching. Case
     insensitive matching behaves as if it normalises the case of all input
     text before matching on it.
   - dot_matches_newline: Enables or disables the dot matches newline option.
     This specifies that the `.` special character should match everything
     _including_ newline characters. Without this flag, it will match all
     characters _except_ newlines.
   - multiline: Enables or disables the multiline option. Multiline specifies
     that the `^` and `$` pattern characters match the start and end of lines,
     as well as the start and end of the input respectively.
   - comments: Enables or disables the comments mode for the regular expression.
     In comments mode, the following changes apply:
     - Whitespace within the pattern is ignored, except when within a
       character class or when preceeded by an unescaped backslash, or within
       grouping constructs (e.g. `(?...)`).
     - When a line contains a `#`, that is not in a character class and is not
       preceeded by an unescaped backslash, all characters from the leftmost
       such `#` to the end of the line are ignored. That is to say, they act
       as _comments_ in the regex.
   - extra_opts: Specifies additional options in a vector. This allows options
     to be supplied and computed without having to break them out into arguments
     to the function. Where these overlap with one of the flags (`match_ascii`,
     `case_insensitive`, `dot_matches_newline`, `multiline` and `verbose`), the
     flags take precedence.

   ! Boolean Flags and Extra Options
     This function contains a number of arguments that are boolean flags that
     enable or disable common options for the regex. At the same time, it also
     provides the ability to specify options in the `extra_opts` argument.

     Where one of the flags is _set_ (has the value `True` or `False`), the
     value of the flag takes precedence over the value in `extra_opts` when
     merging the options to the engine. The flags are _unset_ (have value
     `Nothing`) by default.

   > Example
     Find matches for a basic email regex in some text. NOTE: This regex is
     _not_ compliant with RFC 5322.

         example_match =
             regex = ".+@.+"
             "contact@enso.org".match regex

    compiled_pattern.match this mode

## ALIAS Check Matches

   Matches the text in `this` against the provided regex `pattern`, returning
   `True` if the text matches at least once, and `False` otherwise.

   Arguments:
   - pattern: The pattern to match `this` against. We recommend using _raw text_
     to write your patterns.
   - mode: This argument specifies how many matches the engine will try and
     find. When mode is set to either `Mode.First` or `Mode.Full`, this method
     will return either a single `Match` or `Nothing`. If set to an `Integer` or
     `Mode.All`, this method will return either a `Vector Match` or `Nothing`.
   - match_ascii: Enables or disables pure-ASCII matching for the regex. If you
     know your data only contains ASCII then you can enable this for a
     performance boost on some regex engines.
   - case_insensitive: Enables or disables case-insensitive matching. Case
     insensitive matching behaves as if it normalises the case of all input
     text before matching on it.
   - dot_matches_newline: Enables or disables the dot matches newline option.
     This specifies that the `.` special character should match everything
     _including_ newline characters. Without this flag, it will match all
     characters _except_ newlines.
   - multiline: Enables or disables the multiline option. Multiline specifies
     that the `^` and `$` pattern characters match the start and end of lines,
     as well as the start and end of the input respectively.
   - comments: Enables or disables the comments mode for the regular expression.
     In comments mode, the following changes apply:
     - Whitespace within the pattern is ignored, except when within a
       character class or when preceeded by an unescaped backslash, or within
       grouping constructs (e.g. `(?...)`).
     - When a line contains a `#`, that is not in a character class and is not
       preceeded by an unescaped backslash, all characters from the leftmost
       such `#` to the end of the line are ignored. That is to say, they act
       as _comments_ in the regex.
   - extra_opts: Specifies additional options in a vector. This allows options
     to be supplied and computed without having to break them out into arguments
     to the function. Where these overlap with one of the flags (`match_ascii`,
     `case_insensitive`, `dot_matches_newline`, `multiline` and `verbose`), the
     flags take precedence.

   ! Boolean Flags and Extra Options
     This function contains a number of arguments that are boolean flags that
     enable or disable common options for the regex. At the same time, it also
     provides the ability to specify options in the `extra_opts` argument.

     Where one of the flags is _set_ (has the value `True` or `False`), the

     merging the options to the engine. The flags are _unset_ (have value
     `Nothing`) by default.

    compiled_pattern.matches this

## ALIAS Find Text

   Finds all occurrences of `pattern` in the text `this`, returning the text(s)
   if present, or `Nothing` if there are no matches.

   Arguments:
   - pattern: The pattern to match `this` against. We recommend using _raw text_
     to write your patterns.
   - mode: This argument specifies how many matches the engine will try and
     find. When mode is set to either `Mode.First` or `Mode.Full`, this method
     will return either a single `Text` or `Nothing`. If set to an `Integer` or
     `Mode.All`, this method will return either a `Vector Text` or `Nothing`.
   - match_ascii: Enables or disables pure-ASCII matching for the regex. If you
     know your data only contains ASCII then you can enable this for a
     performance boost on some regex engines.
   - case_insensitive: Enables or disables case-insensitive matching. Case
     insensitive matching behaves as if it normalises the case of all input
     text before matching on it.
   - dot_matches_newline: Enables or disables the dot matches newline option.
     This specifies that the `.` special character should match everything
     _including_ newline characters. Without this flag, it will match all
     characters _except_ newlines.
   - multiline: Enables or disables the multiline option. Multiline specifies
     that the `^` and `$` pattern characters match the start and end of lines,
     as well as the start and end of the input respectively.
   - comments: Enables or disables the comments mode for the regular expression.
     In comments mode, the following changes apply:
     - Whitespace within the pattern is ignored, except when within a
       character class or when preceeded by an unescaped backslash, or within
       grouping constructs (e.g. `(?...)`).
     - When a line contains a `#`, that is not in a character class and is not
       preceeded by an unescaped backslash, all characters from the leftmost
       such `#` to the end of the line are ignored. That is to say, they act
       as _comments_ in the regex.
   - extra_opts: Specifies additional options in a vector. This allows options
     to be supplied and computed without having to break them out into arguments
     to the function. Where these overlap with one of the flags (`match_ascii`,
     `case_insensitive`, `dot_matches_newline`, `multiline` and `verbose`), the
     flags take precedence.

   ! Boolean Flags and Extra Options
     This function contains a number of arguments that are boolean flags that
     enable or disable common options for the regex. At the same time, it also

     merging the options to the engine. The flags are _unset_ (have value
     `Nothing`) by default.

         example_find =
             text = "Now I know my ABCs"
             text.find "\w{1,3}"

    compiled_pattern.find this mode

## ALIAS Split Text

   Takes a separator and returns the vector that results from splitting `this`
   on the configured number of occurrences of `separator`.

   Arguments:
   - separator: The pattern used to split the text.
   - mode: This argument specifies how many matches the engine will try and
     find. When mode is set to either `Mode.First` or `Mode.Full`, this method
     will return either a single `Text` or `Nothing`. If set to an `Integer` or
     `Mode.All`, this method will return either a `Vector Text` or `Nothing`.
   - match_ascii: Enables or disables pure-ASCII matching for the regex. If you
     know your data only contains ASCII then you can enable this for a
     performance boost on some regex engines.
   - case_insensitive: Enables or disables case-insensitive matching. Case
     insensitive matching behaves as if it normalises the case of all input
     text before matching on it.
   - dot_matches_newline: Enables or disables the dot matches newline option.
     This specifies that the `.` special character should match everything
     _including_ newline characters. Without this flag, it will match all
     characters _except_ newlines.
   - multiline: Enables or disables the multiline option. Multiline specifies
     that the `^` and `$` pattern characters match the start and end of lines,
     as well as the start and end of the input respectively.
   - verbose: Enables or disables the verbose mode for the regular expression.
     In verbose mode, the following changes apply:
     - Whitespace within the pattern is ignored, except when within a
       character class or when preceeded by an unescaped backslash, or within
       grouping constructs (e.g. `(?...)`).
     - When a line contains a `#`, that is not in a character class and is not
       preceeded by an unescaped backslash, all characters from the leftmost
       such `#` to the end of the line are ignored. That is to say, they act
       as _comments_ in the regex.
   - extra_opts: Specifies additional options in a vector. This allows options
     to be supplied and computed without having to break them out into arguments
     to the function. Where these overlap with one of the flags (`match_ascii`,

## ALIAS Replace Text

   Replaces each occurrence of `old_sequence` with `new_sequence`, returning
   `this` unchanged if no matches are found.

   Arguments:
   - old_sequence: The pattern to search for in `this`.
   - new_sequence: The text to replace every occurrence of `old_sequence` with.
   - mode: This argument specifies how many matches the engine will try to
     replace.
   - match_ascii: Enables or disables pure-ASCII matching for the regex. If you
     know your data only contains ASCII then you can enable this for a
     performance boost on some regex engines.
   - case_insensitive: Enables or disables case-insensitive matching. Case

     In comments mode, the following changes apply:
     - Whitespace within the pattern is ignored, except when within a
       character class or when preceeded by an unescaped backslash, or within
       grouping constructs (e.g. `(?...)`).
     - When a line contains a `#`, that is not in a character class and is not

## ALIAS Get Words

   Returns a vector containing all words in the given text.

   Arguments:
   - keep_whitespace: Whether or not the whitespace around the words should be
     preserved. If set to `True`, the whitespace will be included as a "word" in
     the output.

   ! What is a Word?
     A word is defined based on the definition of Word Boundaries in the Unicode
     Standard Annex 29, supplemented by language-specific dictionaries for
     Chinese, Japanese, Thai, and Khmer.

   > Example
     Getting the words in the sentence "I have not one, but two cats."

        "I have not one, but two cats.".words
Text.words : Boolean -> Vector.Vector Text
Text.words keep_whitespace=False =
    iterator = BreakIterator.getWordInstance
    iterator.setText this
    bldr = Vector.new_builder
    fst = iterator.first
    nxt = iterator.next

    build prev nxt = if nxt == -1 then Nothing else
        word = Text_Utils.substring this prev nxt
        word_not_whitespace = (Text_Utils.is_whitespace word).not
        if word_not_whitespace then bldr.append word else
            if keep_whitespace then
                bldr.append word

        next_nxt = iterator.next
        @Tail_Call build nxt next_nxt

    build fst nxt

    bldr.to_vector

## Checks whether `this` is equal to `that`.

   Arguments:
   - that: The text to compare `this` for equality with.

   ! Unicode Equality
     The definition of equality includes Unicode canonicalization. I.e. two
     texts are equal if they are identical after canonical decomposition. This
     ensures that different ways of expressing the same character in the
     underlying binary representation are considered equal.

   > Example
     The string 'é' (i.e. the character U+00E9, LATIN SMALL LETTER E WITH ACUTE)
     is canonically the same as the string 'e\u0301' (i.e. the letter `e`
     followed by U+0301, COMBINING ACUTE ACCENT). Therefore:

         ('é' == 'e\u0301') == True
Text.== : Any -> Boolean
Text.== that = if Meta.is_same_object this Text then Meta.is_same_object that Text else
    Text_Utils.equals this that

## Checks whether `this` is equal to `that`, ignoring the case of the texts.

   Arguments:
   - that: The text to compare `this` for case-insensitive equality with.

   Two texts are considered equal ignoring case if they are of the same length
   and corresponding characters are equal ignoring case.

   ! Unicode Equality
     The definition of equality includes Unicode canonicalization. I.e. two
     texts are equal if they are identical after canonical decomposition. This
     ensures that different ways of expressing the same character in the
     underlying binary representation are considered equal.

   > Example
     The string 'É' (i.e. the character U+00C9, LATIN CAPITAL LETTER E WITH
     ACUTE) is equal ignore case to the string 'é' (i.e. the character U+00E9,
     LATIN SMALL LETTER E WITH ACUTE), which is canonically the same as the
     string 'e\u0301' (i.e. the letter `e` followed by U+0301, COMBINING ACUTE
     ACCENT). Therefore:

         (('É' . equals_ignore_case 'é') && ('é' . equals_ignore_case 'e\u0301')) == True
Text.equals_ignore_case : Text -> Boolean
Text.equals_ignore_case that = Text_Utils.equals_ignore_case this that

## Compare two texts to discover their ordering.

   Arguments:
   - that: The text to order `this` with respect to.

   > Example
     Checking how "a" orders in relation to "b".

         "a".compare_to "b"
Text.compare_to : Text -> Ordering
Text.compare_to that =
    comparison_result = Text_Utils.compare_normalized this that
    if comparison_result == 0 then Ordering.Equal else
        if comparison_result < 0 then Ordering.Less else
            Ordering.Greater

## ALIAS Check Emptiness

   Check if `this` is empty.

   ! What is Empty?
     Text is considered to be empty when its length is zero.

   > Example
     Check if the text "aaa" is empty.

         "aaa".is_empty
Text.is_empty : Boolean
Text.is_empty = this == ""

## ALIAS Check Non-Emptiness

   Check if `this` is not empty.

   ! What is Not Empty?
     Text is considered to be not empty when its length is greater than zero.

   > Example
     Check if the text "aaa" is not empty.

         "aaa".not_empty
Text.not_empty : Boolean
Text.not_empty = this.is_empty.not

## Returns if a character from the text at the specified index (0-based) is a
   digit (0-9).

   Arguments:
     - index: The location in the text to get the character from. The
       index is also allowed be negative, then the characters are
       counted from the end of the text, i.e. -1 will correspond to the
       last character.

   ! What is a Character?
     A character is defined as an Extended Grapheme Cluster, see Unicode
     Standard Annex 29. This is the smallest unit that still has semantic
     meaning in most text-processing applications.

   > Example
     Check if an individual character is a digit:

         "0".is_digit == True
         "A0".is_digit == False
         "A0".is_digit 1 == True
         "건반(Korean)".is_digit 1 == False
Text.is_digit : Integer -> Text ! Index_Out_Of_Bounds_Error
Text.is_digit (index=0) =
    grapheme = this.at index

     The definition of equality includes Unicode canonicalization. I.e. two
     texts are equal if they are identical after canonical decomposition. This
     ensures that different ways of expressing the same character in the
     underlying binary representation are considered equal.

   > Example
