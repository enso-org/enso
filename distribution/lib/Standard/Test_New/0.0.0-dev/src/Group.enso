       Arguments:
       - teardown_ref: A reference to a teardown method.
    Impl (builder = Vector.new_builder) (teardown_ref = Ref.new (_ -> Nothing))

    ## Specifies a single test.

       Arguments:
       - name: The name of the test spec. Should be unique within the group.
       - code: A thunk that takes no arguments.
       - pending: Contains a reason for why the test should be ignored. If Nothing, the test
                  is not ignored.

    ## Provide a teardown of a group - a method that will be called once all the tests from the
       group are finished.

       Arguments:
       - code: A function that does the teardown of a group. This function does not take any arguments,
               and its return value is ignored.
