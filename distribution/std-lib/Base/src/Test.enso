## Runs a suite of tests, consisting of multiple `describe` blocks.

   Returns a `Suite` object containing the test report.

   > Example

                 it "should define addition" <|

## Runs a suite of tests, consisting of multiple `describe` blocks.

   Exits the process with code `1` if the suite failed and `0` otherwise.
