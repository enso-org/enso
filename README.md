Visual and textual functional programming language with a focus on productivity,

Enso is a developer’s whiteboard on steroids. Design, prototype, develop and
refactor any application simply by connecting visual elements together.
Collaborate with co-workers, interactively fine tune parameters, inspect the
results and visually profile the performance in real-time.

This repository contains [Enso Engine](engine/) (its compiler, 
interpreter, runtime, and language server). Its cloud-ready IDE can be found in
a [separate repository](https://github.com/luna/ide/).
