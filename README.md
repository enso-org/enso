Luna is a developer’s whiteboard on steroids. Design, prototype, develop and
refactor any application simply by connecting visual elements together.
Collaborate with co-workers, interactively fine tune parameters, inspect the
results and visually profile the performance in real-time.

Visit [The Luna Website](http://www.luna-lang.org) to learn more!

This repository contains the Luna compiler core and its command line version.
For the full (visual) Luna Studio, please take a look at the
[Luna Studio](https://github.com/luna/luna-studio) repository. For installation
and management tools, there is [Luna Manager](https://github.com/luna/luna-manager).
