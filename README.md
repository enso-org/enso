Enso is a developer’s whiteboard on steroids. Design, prototype, develop and
refactor any application simply by connecting visual elements together.
Collaborate with co-workers, interactively fine tune parameters, inspect the
results and visually profile the performance in real-time.

Visit [The Enso Website](http://www.luna-lang.org) to learn more!

This repository contains both the [Enso Engine](engine/) (its compiler, 
interpreter, runtime, and language server), and its cloud-ready [IDE](ide/).
