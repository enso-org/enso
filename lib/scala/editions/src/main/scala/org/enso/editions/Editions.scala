  * back to it. They are just an object model of the underlying YAML format.
  *
  * The raw edition may reference a parent edition or repositories by name.
  * The [[EditionResolver]] takes care of resolving a Raw edition into a
  * Resolved instance by loading and parsing any of its parents and replacing
  * the repository by-name references by actual references to the repository
  * instances.
