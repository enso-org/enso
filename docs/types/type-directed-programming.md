# Type-Directed Programming
When you have a language with as powerful a type system as Enso, you can
leverage the type system to provide users with tools to write their programs
based on types. This is an _advanced_ feature and is not expected to be used by
the novice, but it is nonetheless an important feature for working with a
powerful type system.
