# Graphmod
Graphmod is a utility script for generating `DOT` graphs as images from the
output of various stages of the Enso core language. It is very helpful for:

- Debugging issues with the links in the graph.
- Visualising the structure of the graph.
- Visualising performance problems due to spurious links in the graph.
